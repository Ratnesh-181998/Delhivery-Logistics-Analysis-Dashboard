OBSERVATIONS IN RAW DATA:  
 
• 
Each trip is taking stops between mentioned source and destination centers(warehouses). 
• 
od-end-time and od-start-time are the time when the that particular trip was ended and started. 
 
• 
start-scan-to-end-scan is the time duration of trips are being scanned when start and end.  
 
• 
start-scan-to-end-scan time is given cumulative. which is not given per trip segments. 
 
 
• 
trip cut off False, shows the record of trip when trip changes from one warehouse to another. 
between source to destination.  
 
 
• 
Actual-time given is the time to complete the entire delivery from source to destination (given 
cumulatively) 
 
 
 
 
• 
OSRM -time is an open-source routing engine time calculator which computes the shortest path 
between points in a given map and gives the time and OSRM distance gives the shortest distance 
(given cumulatively) 
 
 
• 
Actual-distance-to-destination is the actual distance between warehouses, given cumulative during 
the trip.  
• 
every time cutoff is False, distance count starts from beginning.  
 
• 
Segment actual time, is the actual time taken between two stops in between trips. given per each 
segment (taken between subset of package delivery) 
 
• 
segment OSRM time is the OSRM segment time, taken between subset of package delivery

Hypothesis Tests for time durations and distance 
related features: 
 
Analysing TimeTaken Between OdStart and OdEnd time & 
StartScanToEndScan : 
H0: Mean of time taken betweenn trip end ans start time = Mean of start and end scan time 
Ha: Mean of time taken betweenn trip end ans start time != Mean of start and end scan time 
 
 
 
from Kolmogorov–Smirnov test , p-value is 0.9943 , from which we can conclude tht both the distributions 
(time_taken_btwn_odstart_and_od_end and start_scan_to_end_scan) are closly similar. 
from 2 sample t-test ,we can also conclude that Average time_taken_btwn_odstart_and_od_end for population is 
also equal to Average start_scan_to_end_scan for population.

================================================================================

Analysing Actual Time taken to complete the delivery & start-scan-
end-scan 
H0: Mean of start and end scan time <= Mean of Actual time taken to complete delivery 
Ha: Mean of start and end scan time > Mean of Actual time taken to complete delivery 
 
 
from KS test for actual-time and start_scan_to_end_scan distributions are not same. 
from ttest of population average actual_time is less than population average start_scan_to_end_scan. 
 
 
Analyzing Actual Time & Time Taken between start and end trip time. 
H0: Mean of Actual time taken to complete delivery = Mean of time taken between trip end and start time 
Ha: Mean of Actual time taken to complete delivery != Mean of time taken betweenn trip end and start time 
 
from above kstest of distribution and two sample ttest , 
we can conclude that population mean Actual time taken to complete delivery and population mean 
time_taken_btwn_od_start_and_od_end are also not same. 
 


================================================================================

================================================================================

Analyzing Actual Time taken to complete delivery from source to 
destination hub & OSRM measured time : 
H0: Mean of OSRM time >= Mean of Actual time taken to complete delivery 
Ha: Mean of OSRM time < Mean of Actual time taken to complete delivery 
 
 
from two sample ttest can conclude , that population mean actual time taken to complete delivery from 
source to warehouse and orsm estimate mean time for population are not same. 
actual time is higher than the osrm estimated time for delivery 
 
 
Analyzing Actual Time taken to complete delivery from source to 
destination hub & Segment Actual Time : 
H0: Actual time = segment actual time 
Ha: Actual time != segment actual time 
 
 
 
from two sample ttest , we can conclude that 
Population average for 
Actual Time taken to complete delivery trip and segment actual time are same.

================================================================================

Analysing osrm Time & segment-osrm-time : 
H0: segment actual time <= OSRM time 
Ha: segment actual time > OSRM time 
 
from ttest , we can conclude that 
average of osrm Time & segment-osrm-time for population is not same. 
Population Mean osrm time is less than Population Mean segment osrm time. 
 
Analysing Distances measures : 
 
Analysing and Visulizing OSRM Estimated distance and Segment-osrm-
distance : 
H0 : Segment OSRM distance <= OSRM distance 
Ha : Segment OSRM distance > OSRM distance 
 
 
from KS test , we can conclude the distributions of segment OSRM distance and OSRM distance are not 
same! 
from two sample one sided t-test, we can conclude: Average of OSRM distance for population is less than 
average of segment OSRM distance 
 


================================================================================

================================================================================

Analyzing and Visualizing OSRM Estimated distance and Actual 
Distance between source and destination warehouse : 
H0 : Mean OSRM distance <= Mean Actual distance 
Ha : Mean OSRM distance > Mean Actual distance 
 
 
From left sided t-test , we can conclude 
for population OSRM estimated distance is higher than the actual distance from source to destination 
warehouse.

Recommendations : 
• 
As per analysis, It is recommended to use Carting (small vehicles) for delivery with in the city in 
order to reduce the delivery time, and Heavy trucks for long distance trips or heavy load. based on 
this , we can optimize the delivery time as well as increase the revenue as per requirements. 
• 
Incresing the connectivity in tier 2 and tier 3 cities along with profession tie-ups with several e-
commerce giants can increase the revenue as well as the reputation on connectivity across borders. 
• 
We can work on optimizing the scanning time on both ends which is start scanning time and end 
scanning time so that the delivery time can be equated to the OSRM estimated delivery time.
